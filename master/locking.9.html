<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
There are several mechanisms in the Keyronex kernel for synchronisation between
  threads and between threads and interrupt handlers. These mechanisms vary in
  characteristics.
<p class="Pp" id="Thread">A major division is between the contexts in which they
    can be used. Context is mostly defined by what
    <a class="Xr" href="ipl.9.html">ipl(9)</a> level execution is at.
    <a class="permalink" href="#Thread"><i class="Em">Thread context</i></a>,
    for example, is generally at low IPL, while
    <a class="permalink" href="#DPC"><i class="Em" id="DPC">DPC context</i></a>
    (see <a class="Xr" href="dpc.9.html">dpc(9)</a>) is at
    <code class="Dv">kIPLDPC</code>, and
    <a class="permalink" href="#hard"><i class="Em" id="hard">hard interrupt
    context</i></a> at <code class="Dv">kIPLDevice</code>. In each case, the IPL
    level can also be temporarily raised - but it cannot be lowered below the
    level at which the context was entered.</p>
<p class="Pp">In general, low IPL refers to an IPL less than
    <code class="Dv">kIPLDPC</code>, and high IPL to an IPL greater than or
    equal to <code class="Dv">kIPLDPC</code>.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Spinlocks"><a class="permalink" href="#Spinlocks">Spinlocks</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Spinlocks are the most basic locking mechanism in the Keyronex
    kernel, and the only one that can be used in all contexts. Each has an
    associated an IPL, and execution is raised to that level when the lock is
    held. This IPL must be greater than <code class="Dv">kIPLDPC</code>. They do
    not block, but spin until the lock is available. This is why they are not
    suitable for holding for extended periods of time.</p>
<p class="Pp">See <a class="Xr" href="spinlock.9.html">spinlock(9)</a> for more
    information. <a class="Xr" href="ipl.9.html">ipl(9)</a> details the
    restrictions incurred by high-IPL operation inherent to spinlocks.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Mutexes"><a class="permalink" href="#Mutexes">Mutexes</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Mutexes are a heavy-weight mechanism. They can be acquired only
    from thread context while at IPL less than <code class="Dv">kIPLDPC</code>,
    but can be released at that IPL in principle. They block, and a thread is
    put to sleep until the mutex is available.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Events"><a class="permalink" href="#Events">Events</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Events can be waited on only from thread context at low IPL, but
    may be signalled at <code class="Dv">kIPLDPC</code>. They carry a signalled
    flag that can be set and cleared, and a thread can wait on an event,
    sleeping until the signalled flag is set. The flag remains set until
    explicitly cleared.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Semaphores"><a class="permalink" href="#Semaphores">Semaphores</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Everyone knows what semaphores are. The rules on their use in
    Keyronex are similar to those for events: waiting requires low IPL, but
    signalling is also allowed at <code class="Dv">kIPLDPC</code>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="RWLocks"><a class="permalink" href="#RWLocks">RWLocks</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Reader-Writer Locks (or RWLocks) will be implemented in the
    future. They will be the preferred mechanism for most synchronisation (both
    reader-writer and simple cases) as they will provide priority inheritance,
    adaptively spin, and be small (word-sized). The APIs currently exist but the
    implementation is trivial and lacks the features described here.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="RCU"><a class="permalink" href="#RCU">RCU</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Read-Copy-Update is a mechanism that allows reader access to data
    structures without locking or blocking, even while writers are modifying the
    data, by means of deferring the freeing of old data until all readers have
    finished with it. Writers still have to synchronise with each other through
    traditional means like spinlocks or mutexes. RCU is not as easy to use as
    the other mechanisms.</p>

    information.</p>
